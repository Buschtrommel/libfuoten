# libfuoten
A [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) based library to provide access to the ownCloud / Nextcloud [News App](https://github.com/nextcloud/news) API.

libfuoten implements the complete [New App REST API v1.2](https://github.com/nextcloud/news/blob/master/docs/externalapi/Legacy.md) and provides interfaces to create Qt applications talking to an ownCloud/Nextcloud server with News App enabled. Beside the API implementation classes there are classes to support local storage and models to represent the stored data. Helper classes make it easier to synchronize local storage with the remote server.

Have a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/Huessenbergnetz/Fuoten/milestones) for further information about the development plans. Find out more in the [API documentation](https://doc.huessenbergnetz.de/libfuoten/?pk_campaign=Github-Project-Libfuoten&pk_kwd=ReadmeFile) of libfuoten.

## Features
* account validation (request version, status and user)
* folder management (synchronization, adding, deleting, renaming, marking as read)
* folder list model and filtering
* feeds management (synchronization, adding, deleting, renaming, marking as read, moving)
* feeds list model and filtering
* articles management (synchronization, marking as read/unread/starred/unstarred)
* articles list model and filtering
* synchronization class
* SQLite storage class

## Contributing
The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/Huessenbergnetz/libfuoten), feel free to clone or branch according to the [LGPLv3](https://github.com/Huessenbergnetz/libfuoten/blob/master/LICENSE). Translation is done on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/huessenbergnetz/libfuoten).

## Getting libfuoten
* [openSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/package/libfuoten)

## Building libfuoten
Either clone the git repository or download one of the [release](https://github.com/Huessenbergnetz/libfuoten/releases) tarballs. zlib and Qt 5.6 or newer are required to build libfuoten as well as the following Qt modules: Qt5Core, Qt5Network and Qt5Sql.

### Install dependencies
Install gcc, g++, qmake, make, zlib, Qt5Core, Qt5Network and Qt5Sql.

#### openSUSE

```
sudo zypper in gcc-++ make zlib-devel libqt5-qtbase-common-devel libqt5-qtbase-devel libQt5Core-devel libQt5Network-devel libQt5Sql-devel
```
For creating documentation:
```
sudo zypper in doxygen libqt5-qtdoc-devel libqt5-qttools
```

### Available qmake variables
* INSTALL_PREFIX_DIR - defaults to QT_INSTALL_PREFIX
* INSTALL_LIB_DIR - defaults to QT_INSTALL_LIBS
* INSTALL_TRANSLATIONS_DIR - defaults to QT_INSTALL_TRANSLATIONS
* INSTALL_HEADERS_DIR - defaults to QT_INSTALL_HEADERS
* QHG_BIN_PATH - defaults to QT_INSTALL_BINS/qhelpgenerator - used by the qhpdoc target
* QT_TAG_FILES_PATH - defaults to QT_INSTALL_DOCS - used to link API documentation

You can show the default values with `qmake -query`.

### Available qmake CONFIG options

#### clazy
`CONFIG+=clazy` enables the clazy static code checks (level 0, 1 and 2) and will set clang++ as compiler.

#### asan
`CONFIG+=asan` enables [address sanitizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer).

#### no_install_dev_files
`CONFIG+=no_install_dev_files` disables the installation of the header files.

### Additional make targets

#### docs
Will create HTML and QCH API documentation files. Use the `QHG_BIN_PATH` variable to set a proper path to the `qhelpgenerator` executable to create the Qt Compiled Help files for use in Qt Creator. You can link Qt classes into the documentation by setting a valid path to tag files in the `QT_TAG_FILES_PATH` variable. If the necessary tag files are found, the documenation will automatically link to the appropriate Qt help page.

### Get libfuoten and build it
On openSUSE qmake for qt5 is named qmake-qt5.

```
git clone https://github.com/Huessenbergnetz/libfuoten.git
cd libfuoten
mkdir build && cd build
qmake -r ..
make
sudo make install
```
